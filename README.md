This project is one of my first websites, and it focuses on certain current issues. 
My website focuses on the lack of guidance for non college bound students. It is apparent
in a community that has a great amount of manufacturing jobs how unprepared high school 
graduates really are when entering the workforce. I asked multiple people in my community
that are involved with HR what their major complaints were for newly graduated hirees. I 
heard multiple including attendace, lack of secession planning, no trade experience, and 
not knowing how to make a simple resume. After hearing that these issues were becoming 
serious problems, I wanted to make a change. Using this website, I hope to help students 
and local businesses connect in schools to show students all the opportunities for their 
careers right out of high school. I want to do this by scheduling an alternative to college 
fairs, so instead of having only colleges come visit the school to show off what they do, 
businesses will also be able to. These fairs would be great for the 40% of high school 
graduates that did not go to college. 

DISCLAIMER--- This is not to discourage anyone about going to college. Going to college is 
              great! But there should be some light shed on the other pathways out of high
              school.
